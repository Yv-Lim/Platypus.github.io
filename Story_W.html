<h1> Platypus:</h1>
   <p style="font-size:25px;"> One day a duck got lost and met a water rat. <br> They fell in love and gave birth to what is now known as me, the Platypus. <br> I share the fur of my dad, the water rat, and the bill and webbed feet of my mum, the duck. <br> Thanks for listening to my story, here is a clue to get Koala to warm up to you. While I love being pet, Koala is not so fond of it.</p>
