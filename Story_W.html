<h1> Platypus:</h1>
   <p style="font-size:25px;"> One day a duck got lost and met a water rat. <br> They fell in love and gave birth to what is now known as me, the Platypus. <br> I share the fur of my dad, the water rat, and the bill and webbed feet of my mum, the duck. <br> Thanks for listening to my story, here is a clue to find Koala: <br>Koala can be found near its favourite gum trees, <br> But it was tricked and is quite displeased, <br>The leaves are there but Koala can't eat,<br> look for the mural just along Bowen street.</p>
