  <p style="font-size: 28px; position: absolute; top: 130; left: 50; z-index: 1;">Purr...! Thank you for the pat! My fur seems even smoother! <br> In return, I want to tell you a story...</p>
    <p style="font-size: 28px; position: absolute; top: 210; left: 70; z-index: 1;">One day a duck got lost and met a water rat. They fell in love and gave birth <br> to what is now known as me, the Platypus. I share the fur of my dad, the <br> water rat, and the bill and webbed feet of my mum, the duck. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 28px; position: absolute; top: 330; left: 50; z-index: 1;"> Thanks for listening to my story, here is a clue to find Koala: <br>Koala can be found near its favorite gum trees, <br> But it was tricked and is quite displeased, <br>The leaves are there but Koala can't eat,<br> look for the mural just along Bowen street.</p>
